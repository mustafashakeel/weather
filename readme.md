Here are some of the tools & Technologies I used:

React - This was the JavaScript framework used.
React Router - Is used for the demonstration of the navigation for this SPA App
Foundation - Framework is used for styling and to make it responsive
Webpack - Is used to bunder and modularize this Project.
Expressjs ( Node js ) - Is the Local Server used
Open Weather Map - I used Open Weather Map to search for weather data by city name.
